1)	The first part of the quiz is just implementing a random asci character. I first set the min and max of the acsii set and then use the rand() function to pull between them. Finally, I return the ascii value. 
2)	For the second part of the quiz, which is to implement a string of size 5 that contains the letters 'r', 'e' , 's' , 't'. I created a string of size 6 and then created a character pool. I used a for loop to generate a random character for each of the string spots. Finally end the string with the string return. 

The program simpley loops through your call to inputChar() and inputString() until it matches the ones in the main function. The error message is called if something messes up which didn't happen during my execution. 

Code compiles with make all
Executes with an average iteration of about 900
